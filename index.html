    <title>Maximum Profit from Stocks</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="details">Hi this is my internship code by Rohit Biswas 8420743341</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="question">Given an array of positive integers representing the prices of a single stock on
        various days (each index in the array represents a different day). <br><br> You're also
        given an integer: k, which represents the number of transactions
          you're allowed to make. One transaction consists of buying the stock on a
          given day and selling it on another, later day.
          <br>
          <br>
        
        
          Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make by buying
          and selling the stock, given k transactions.
        
        
        
          Note that you can only hold one share of the stock at a time; in other words,
          you can't buy more than one share of the stock on any given day, and you can't
          buy a share of the stock if you're still holding another share. Also, you
          don't need to use all k transactions that you're allowed.
          <br>
          <br>
        
        Sample Input :
        <br> 
        prices = [5,11,3,50,60,90] <br>
        k=2
        <br><br>
        Sample Output: <br>
        93 <br><br>
        Explanation: Buy : 5, Sell :11, Buy: 3, Sell:90
        <br>
        Profit :93
